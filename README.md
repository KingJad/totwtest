Okay, so this should actually work for pushing/pulling? Now you people can actually work on it too lmao

Anyway! I'm gonna copy paste the README from the last thingy

# take-over-the-world-game
School project!! Let's see how far we can go with it before the end of the year :)


Controls (In the Explore minigame/basically anything that isn't point and click):

x = exit

i = inventory

y = use tool

arrow keys = movement


Notes:

The enemies (slimes) just go back and forth, the regular ones take 5 hits to kill. The slime boss has a health bar you can see, and depending on how many swords you go in with, you can take it down to basically nothing as soon as you go in.

You unlock more places to go as you progress in the Explore part. There's only the Forest, Cave, and Slime King's Cave right now.

There isn't a war function implemented yet, the only way to fight is real-time slashing stuff.

There are materials in the Explore game you can pick up, with the exception of Trees (the big greeen squares) that take one Axe to cut down. You can craft Axes in the Craft menu, and use them by pressing Y. It doesn't use up any axes just to press Y, you only lose axes if you hit a tree.

There are default names if you don't input anything at the beginning. I'm not creative, so they're just Tagalog for 'Me' (Ako) and 'Kingdom' (Kaharian). On another note, the NPC is named Kuya because it means 'brother'.
